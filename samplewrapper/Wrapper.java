/*
* Based on this implementation, we need to write the code inorder to avoid duplicate method names
* Whenever yu start working on the test automation world, your first work will be yu have technically design
* At the framework level, yu have to design the interface
* It cannot be done by everyone, maybe the individual guy who is strong within your team assign the particular work to a person
* or some set of persons
* Once the interface is create like this, they should give the interface to the technical team -> Team Lead
* They should start writing the implementation of this interface function
* We need to write the logic for this interface in the class
* Create a class named base class
* If yu want to me the connection b/w the class and interface yu need to use the keyword called implements
* 
* We are going for interface for 2 reasons, one is for 100% abstraction
* Another is for achieving multiple inheritance
* 
* When yu write a method in interface, by default abstract will be included in the method signature
* By default it will be considered as abstract method
* There is no need of writing it manually
* public abstract void launchApp(String browser, String url);
* Your name Resoni, calling as hey human Resoni wont be good which is similar to 
* public abstract void launchApp(String browser, String url);
